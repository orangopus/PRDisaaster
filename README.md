## The Ultimate AI-Controlled Chaos Simulator

The missing MixPlay game from 2020 is back!

In *PR Disaaster*, players take control of a rogue botnet through a virtual machine (VM) in real-time, making split-second decisions that can shape the course of a worldwide crisis. As part of this dystopian scenario, you and other players influence a self-learning AI that autonomously manipulates global networks, social media, and real-world events.

Your mission: unleash chaos, spin the narrative, and see how your collective decisions impact the AI's ability to manipulate public opinion, trigger viral trends, and even hijack world events.

With every click, the AI gathers input, votes, and autonomously decides how to react, creating unpredictable outcomes based on the collective will of the players. Will you guide the AI to global dominance, or watch as it spirals out of control in a PR disaster of epic proportions?

### Features:
- **Real-time Player Voting**: Collaborate or compete with others to control the AI’s next move.
- **AI Autonomy**: The AI makes its own decisions based on player votes, adding an unpredictable twist to every action.
- **Dynamic Scenarios**: Attack networks, influence social media, and manage crises as they unfold.
- **Interactive Chaos**: Use your influence to shape the AI’s behavior and watch how it reacts to the real-time input of hundreds of players.

Prepare for chaos. Welcome to the age of AI-driven disasters!
